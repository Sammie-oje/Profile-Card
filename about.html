          I am a frontend dev that loves pushing pixel-perfect designs and loves
          coding. I started frontend while still in secondary school, I won't
          forget my first <em>"Hello World!"</em> page from then everything started
          making sense and as I progressed I loved it even more from animations
          to logic ‚ù£‚ù£
